  I’m a builder at heart—someone who blends tech, creativity, and product thinking to solve problems that *actually matter*.

  I've worked across AI, ML, full-stack, and cloud—but my real edge? Turning raw ideas into smart, user-driven products that feel 10x better than what's out there.

  I don’t just ship features. I obsess over the *why*, the *who*, and the *how*—until people say, “Damn, that’s clever.”

  Right now, I’m carving my path into product management, not just to manage, but to lead with clarity, curiosity, and bold execution.

  Let’s create products that matter — and make people say, ‘that’s brilliant.
