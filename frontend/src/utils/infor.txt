What Goes in utils?

1. Helper Functions: Small reusable functions used across the app. Example: Date formatting, string manipulation, array filtering.

2. API Call Functions: Centralize HTTP requests for better maintenance. Example: Functions for GET, POST, etc., API endpoints.

3. Constants: Store fixed values, like app-wide URLs, configuration, or enums.

4. Validators: Functions for input validation (e.g., email validation, form checks).

5. Math/Logic Helpers: Common mathematical or logical operations.

6. Custom Hooks: Custom React hooks (useFetch, useDebounce, etc.) that encapsulate reusable stateful logic.
